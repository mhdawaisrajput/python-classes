# Identity and Membership Operators in Python

## 1. `is` Operator (Identity Operator)
The `is` operator checks whether two variables refer to the **same memory location**.

### Example:
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 10
print(num1 is num2)  # Output: True

# OR:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)  # True â†’ Both refer to the same object in memory
print(a is c)  # False â†’ Different objects with the same value
```

---

## 2. `is not` Operator (Identity Operator)
The `is not` operator checks whether two variables refer to **different memory locations**.

### Example:
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
print(num1 is not num2)  # Output: True

# OR:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is not b)  # False â†’ Both refer to the same object in memory
print(a is not c)  # True â†’ Different objects with the same value
```

---

## 3. `in` Operator (Membership Operator)
The `in` operator checks whether a **value exists within an iterable** (e.g., list, tuple, string, dictionary keys).

### Example:
```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange"]

print("Apple" in fruits)  # True â†’ "Apple" is in the list
print("Grapes" in fruits)  # False â†’ "Grapes" is not in the list
```

---

## 4. `not in` Operator (Membership Operator)
The `not in` operator checks whether a **value does not exist within an iterable**.

### Example:
```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange"]

print("Apple" not in fruits)  # False â†’ "Apple" is in the list
print("Grapes" not in fruits)  # True â†’ "Grapes" is not in the list
```

---

âœ… **Summary:**
- `is` â†’ Checks if two variables reference the **same object**.
- `is not` â†’ Checks if two variables reference **different objects**.
- `in` â†’ Checks if a **value exists** in an iterable.
- `not in` â†’ Checks if a **value does not exist** in an iterable.
